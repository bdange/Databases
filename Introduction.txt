7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

date	                        amount
2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	1500.0000
2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	37.0000
2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	124.9300
2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	54.7200

This first table will have the columns dates and amounts selected from the payments database. 


     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

amount
1500.0000

In that case, we will select the column amounts, from the payments db, but only those above 500.

     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

date	                        payee	        amount	        memo
